torrentzip is a Go implementation of [trrntzip](http://trrntzip.sourceforge.net/). It is used to create zip files that are consistent: if two zip creators add the exact same files and directories to their zip files, they produce the bit-exact same  zip files, independent of platform they're on (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc) and independent of file metadata (creation time, modified time, etc) of the files added.

The API of this Go implementation is identical to the [Writer](http://golang.org/pkg/archive/zip/#Writer) part of the 
[archive/zip](http://golang.org/pkg/archive/zip) Go standard library package.

## zlib on Windows

This section is about how to build zlib v1.2.8 from scratch on Microsoft Windows 64bit.

In order to build zlib we will need to instal mingw64 and msys.

Kemovitra published a great how-to on installing both mingw64 and msys in this [blog entry.](http://kemovitra.blogspot.com/2012/11/installing-mingw-w64-on-windows.html#.UcdI4vmfh2F) When using this how-to, please keep in mind to use *c:\mingw* for both mingw64 and msys.

Once installed we can download and build the 64-bit zlib.

Download the [zlib v.1.2.8 source](http://www.zlib.net/) Once downloaded and unpacked, open a msys command prompt and execute the following command in the zlib v1.2.8  folder:

    make -f win32/Makefile.gcc CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc RC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres

Then install the files:

    make -f win32/Makefile.gcc install BINARY_PATH=/mingw/bin INCLUDE_PATH=/mingw/include LIBRARY_PATH=/mingw/lib SHARED_MODE=1
 
Lastly, copy the 
> zlib1.dll

to the location where you will later on also put the torrentzip.exe, as both files are needed for the application to work.

## Implementation

The implementation adapts [archive/zip](http://golang.org/pkg/archive/zip) to use [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) instead of 
the Go standard package [compress/flate](http://golang.org/pkg/compress/flate). This is necessary because the torrentzip standard requires zlib. Integrating zlib was done similar to how [vitess](https://code.google.com/p/vitess/) did it.

The torrentzip format does not allow data declaration sections. This implies that the zip file headers need to know compressed sizes. This was solved by first writing into a temp file using data declaration section and then writing it to the specified io.Writer with torrentzip headers (compression is done only once).

## Format explained

This section is the document [trrntzip_explained.doc](http://www.romvault.com/trrntzip_explained.doc) by GordonJ converted to Markdown. 

torrentzip is a valid zip file. For a full description of the zip files specification:

trrntzip is the reference implementation. For the trrntzip source code:

ZLib Compression:

[http://zlib.net/](http://zlib.net/)

#### General format of a torrentzipped .zip file with n files:

* [local file header 1]
* [file data 1]
* [local file header 2]
* [file data 2]
*    ... 
* [local file header n]
* [file data n]
* <- start of central directory (SOCD File offset)
* [central directory file 1]
* [central directory file 2]
*    ... 
* [central directory file n]
* <-end of central directory (EOCD File offset)
* [end of central directory record]

#### Local file header x: (Showing torrentzipped default values)

* UInt32 Local file header signature (0x04034b50)
* UInt16 Version needed to extract 20 = File is compressed using Deflate compression
* UInt16 General purpose bit flag 2 = Maximum compression option was used
* UInt16 Compression method 8 = The file is Deflated
* UInt16 Last mod file time 48128 = 11:32 PM   
* UInt16 Last mod file date 8600 = 12/24/1996
* UInt32 CRC-32 = File CRC
* UInt32 Compressed size = File Compressed Size
* UInt32 Uncompressed size = File Uncompressed Size
* UInt16 Filename length = Filename length
* UInt16 Extra field length 0 = No extra field information
* Byte[] Filename(variable size) = Byte array of filename

> Notes:
> The default values shown are required to have consistent torrentzipped files.
> Default time/date of 11:32pm 12/24/1996 is the date of the first ever MAME release.

#### File data x:

The data compression must be exactly as ZLib using maximum compression level 9.

#### Central Directory file x: (Showing torrentzipped default values)

* UInt32 Central file header signature (0x02014b50)
* UInt16 Version made by 0 = MS-DOS and OS/2 (FAT/FAT32 file systems)
* UInt16 Version needed to extract 20 = File is compressed using Deflate compression
* UInt16 General purpose bit flag 2 = Maximum compression option was used
* UInt16 Compression method 8 = The file is Deflated 
* UInt16 Last mod file time 48128 = 11:32 PM
* UInt16 Last mod file date 8600 = 12/24/1996
* UInt32 CRC-32 = File CRC
* UInt32 Compressed size = File Compressed Size
* UInt32 Uncompressed size = File Uncompressed Size

* UInt16 Number of this disk 0 = Multi disk storage not used so set to disk 0
* UInt16 Number of the disk with the start of the central directory 0 = Multi disk storage not used so set to disk 0
* UInt16 Total number of entries in the central directory on this disk n = Total number of files 
* UInt16 Total number of entries in the central directory n = Total number of files
* UInt32 Size of the central directory EOCD-SOCD = length of the central directories
* UInt32 Offset of start of central directory with respect to the starting disk number SOCD = Start of central directory
* UInt16 .ZIP file comment length 22 = torrentzipped comment
* Byte[22] .ZIP file comment TORRENTZIPPED-XXXXXXXX

> Notes:
> See above 'General format of a torrentzipped .zip file with n files' for SOCD & EOCD

#### The TorrentZipped Files Comments:

The .ZIP file comments in the End of Central directory is used to check the validity of the torrentzipped file. The comment must be formatted as the 22 bytes of TORRENTZIPPED-XXXXXXXX. The XXXXXXXX is the CRC32 of the central directory records stored as hexadecimal upper case text (the CRC32 of the bytes in the file between SOCD & EOCD).

This comment ensures that if any change is made to the files within the zip this checksum will no longer match the byte data in the central directory, and in this way we can check the validity of a torrentzip file.

#### File Order with a TorrentZip:

For the creation of consistent torrentzipped files, the file order is also very import. Files must be sorted by filename using a lower case sort.

#### Directory separator character:

As zips only store files (not directories), files in directories are represented by storing a relative path to the filename. For example file ‘test1.rom’ in directory ‘set1’ would be stored with a filename of ‘set1/test1.rom’. Some zipping programs will store this as ‘set1\\test1.rom’.

This leads to a possible naming inconsistency. The zip file format state “All slashes should be forward slashes ‘/’ as opposed to backwards slashes ‘\\’ “. So Torrentzip will change all ‘\\’ character to ‘/’.

> Notes:
> This must be done before sorting, to ensure that the sort is performed correctly.) 

#### Directory Entries and Empty Directories:

A directory entry is stored in a zip by adding a file entry ending in a directory separator character with a zero size and CRC. So directory ‘set1’ would be stored as a zero length, zero CRC file called ‘set1\\’.

Some zip programs when adding the previously mentioned file ‘set1\\test1.rom’ will also add the directory ‘set1\\’, this creates an inconsistency problem. In this example the ‘set1\\’ directory entry is unnecessary, as the filename ‘set1\\test1.rom’ implies the existents of the ‘set1\\’ directory. To resolve this inconsistency not needed directories should be removed from the zip, the only needed directory entries are empty directories that are not implied by any file entries.

Example:

FileName Size CRC

set1\\ 0 00000000

set1\\test1.rom 1024 53AC4D0

set2\\ 0 00000000

The set1\\ entry should be removed, as it is implied by the set1\\test1.rom file. The set2\\ entry should be kept to create the empty directory, as removing it would completely remove the set2 directory.

#### Repeat Files:

Another test that could be performed is checking for repeat file entries inside the zip, most zip programs have a hard time handling this and will just ignore this repeat giving the user no way of knowing there is a repeat filename problem. So it would fix another possible inconsistency if torrentzip scanning at least warned about repeat filename being found inside a zip.
